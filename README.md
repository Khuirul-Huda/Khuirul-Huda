2. Java<br>
**MY FIRST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!!!!** -- I didn't know it was called Java before. because it was when I was 13 years old. At that time I used an Android application (which is no longer available on PS) to create an Android application where the application uses Java. The first android application (published) that I made was the Tasbih application. Next is.... ***** (chat me for next stories about this)*****  i develop a Spigot plugins using Java too
