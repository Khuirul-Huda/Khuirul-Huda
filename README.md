### 👋 Hi There!
Call me **Huda**. I'm currently an Informatics Engineering student at a state university in Indonesia.

With over 2 years of experience in game server administration, I manage a small but passionate gaming community. I love coding and customizing everything—from my operating system to server configurations.  
I even ran pure Linux for 2 years on a low-end laptop. That journey taught me how to squeeze performance out of minimal hardware through optimization, patience, and creativity.
